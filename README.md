Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, costs, and overall workforce stability. Understanding why employees leave can help companies develop effective retention strategies and improve workplace satisfaction.

This project aims to analyze employee attrition patterns using HR analytics data. By exploring key factors such as department, salary, work experience, and job satisfaction, the project provides insights into what drives employees to leave. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to identify trends and actionable insights.

Through this study, HR professionals can make data-driven decisions to minimize attrition, enhance employee engagement, and improve organizational growth.

CONCLUSION: 
  Key Factors Affecting Attrition: The analysis revealed that departments, salary levels, work experience, and job satisfaction significantly impact employee turnover.
Department-Wise Insights: Some departments experience higher attrition rates, indicating potential issues related to workload, management, or career growth opportunities.
Salary and Retention: Employees in lower salary brackets tend to leave more frequently, emphasizing the importance of competitive compensation.
Work Experience & Tenure: Employees with fewer years at the company are more likely to leave, suggesting onboarding and engagement strategies can improve retention.
Importance of Work-Life Balance: Employees who reported poor work-life balance showed a higher likelihood of leaving. Companies should focus on policies that support a healthy work environment.
Future Scope: Implementing predictive models can help HR departments proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and take preventive actions.
